Adding new unit tests:
======================
1. unit tests for libsrsbsns module 'foo' go inside 'unittests/test_foo.c'.
   If that file exists already, proceed with step 4.

2. Otherwise, create it.  See test_ptrlist.c for how the top lines should look
   (in particular, the unit test file should #include "unittests_common.h".

3. Edit unittests/Makefile.am, add 'test_foo' to the top line (words are separated by space).
   Then add three new lines similar to those starting with 'test_ptrlist_'. Obviously adjust
   'ptrlist' to your module name, keep everything else.
   NOTE THE 'run_' prefix in the _SOURCES line! Don't forget it!

4. Now inside unittests/test_foo.c, each unit test is made up by one function
   like this:
const char* /*UNITTEST*/
test_whatever(void)
{
	/* test someting */
	return "error message on failure";
	// return NULL; if the test succeeded
/* ... */
}
    The format of the first two lines MUST be kept, don't add whitespace or
    anything, simply do not mess with it :).  Return NULL if a test went good.
    Multiple such functions per file are okay.

5. That's kind of it.  You will need to ./configure again and may, after
   building, run the tests with 'make test'
